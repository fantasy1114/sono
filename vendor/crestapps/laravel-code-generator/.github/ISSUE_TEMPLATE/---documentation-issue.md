The Laravel-code-generator documentation has its own dedicated repository. Please open your documentation-related issue at https://github.com/CrestApps/crestapps-site. **However, since documentation issues are not reviewed very often, it's best to simply make a pull request to correct the issue you have found!**

Thanks!
